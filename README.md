## THIS COMPONENT IS NOT YET WORKING [2025-03-29]
It was forked in an attempt to add Currency to the user config for cases (like mine) where the Green Button 
feed does not include it. Eventually I'd love to replace the XML paste box with a URL (even better,
a webservice call). But ATM I'm in over my head. Will I ever get back to this repo? Time will tell. :) ~a
